# Digital Technologies Hackathon 2022!! ðŸš€

My name is [Lisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_for_Instruction_Set_Architecture) [Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)) (but don't get hung up on my name) and I would like to formally welcome you to the Digital Technologies 2022 Hackathon. I'm the CEO of, [Euphoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euphoria_(programming_language)) a company that builds "experiences". I'm sure you've all heard of us. We are looking to develop a new product that uses computer vision at it's core. That's why we've hired all of you. Your experiences working for Tharsus mean you're all skilled enough to invent innovative, forward thinking and market leading product ideas.

## Task 1: Form sub teams (5 minutes)

First things first, please separate yourselves into three groups as equally spaced as you can. I'd recommend you have someone in each team that knows something about Embedded systems...

## Task 2: Pick a sub team name (5 minutes)

The next five minutes may will decide how well you do on this challenge overall, picking a team name is a serious task. If you get stuck then you could always use a dessert from the popular npm library [random desserts](https://github.com/n1ckdm/random-desserts).

## Task 3: Retrieve your equipment (10 minutes)

There should be a box (possibly situated on David Fairbairn's desk or in the room with you depending upon how well this has been organised. Inside the box there are a number of items, please divide these up amoungst the teams, each team should have:

- An ESP32 microcontroller
- A wifi antenna
- Camera
- USB to serial TTL cable
- Power pack
- A pair of Euphoria standard issue safety glasses for each team member

As a side note, the safety glasses are not a joke. We take your safety _very_ seriously, so please wear these at all times during the Hackathon.

## Task 4: Health and Safety photo (2 minutes)

To ensure that all Hackathon participants are adhering to health and safety requirements, we need a group photo of everyone with their safety glasses fitted prior to the Hackathon beginning. Random spot checks will take place throughout the day. Please email this photo to the Digital Technologies email address.

## Task 5: Start Hacking! (?? minutes)

Assuming you've stayed on schedule, we're 22 minutes into the Hackathon, so you better get started! As the CEO, I don't have any specific technical help I can give you for how to use the equipment you've been provided, but I've been told that these things are relatively straightforward to Google... Good luck and build something amazing!
